a data type defines the type of data a variable can store and the amount of memory it will occupy. It also dictates the operations that can be performed on that data. C is a statically typed language, meaning the data type of a variable must be specified during its declaration and cannot be changed later.

C data types are broadly categorized as follows:
    - Basic Data Types (Primary/Built-in): These are fundamental types for representing various numerical and character values.
        int: Stores whole numbers (integers).
        char: Stores single characters.
        float: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).
        double: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers, offering higher precision than float.
        void: Represents the absence of a value, often used in function declarations.
        _Bool: (or bool in C99 and later with <stdbool.h>) Stores Boolean values (true/false).

    - Derived Data Types: These are constructed by combining basic data types to create more complex structures.
        Arrays: Collections of elements of the same data type.
        Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses of other variables.
        Structures: User-defined data types that group together variables of different data types under a single name.
        Unions: Similar to structures, but all members share the same memory location, allowing storage of different data types in the same space at different times.

    - Enumerated Data Types (enum): These allow you to define a set of named integer constants, improving code readability and maintainability.
