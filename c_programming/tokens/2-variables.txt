a variable is a named storage location in memory used to hold data. Variables are fundamental for storing and manipulating data during program execution.

syntax:

data_type var_name = value;

Key aspects of C variables:
Declaration: Before a variable can be used, it must be declared. This involves specifying its data type and a unique name (identifier). The data type determines the kind of values the variable can store (e.g., int for integers, float for floating-point numbers, char for characters) and the amount of memory it occupies.

Example: 

int age; // Declares an integer variable named 'age'
float price; // Declares a floating-point variable named 'price'
char initial; // Declares a character variable named 'initial'

Initialization: Variables can be initialized with a value at the time of declaration or later in the program.

int count = 10; // Declares and initializes 'count' to 10
float salary;
salary = 50000.0f; // Initializes 'salary' later
    
Example: 

int age = 19;
float weight = 34.67;
