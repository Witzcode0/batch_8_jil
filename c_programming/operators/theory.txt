In C programming, an operator is a symbol that instructs the compiler to perform a specific mathematical, logical, or other operation on one or more operands. Operands are the values or variables upon which the operator acts.

Example

c = a + b
here,
c, a, b - Operands
=, +, - operators

Types of Operators in C:
------------------------
C provides a rich set of built-in operators, categorized as follows:

    1] Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations (e.g., +, -, *, /, %).

    2] Relational Operators: Compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false) (e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).

    3] Logical Operators: Combine or modify boolean expressions (e.g., && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)).

    4] Bitwise Operators: Operate on individual bits of integer data (e.g., &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>).

    5] Assignment Operators: Assign a value to a variable (e.g., =, +=, -=, *=, /=).

    6] Conditional (Ternary) Operator: A shorthand for if-else statements (e.g., condition ? expression1 : expression2).

    7] Increment/Decrement Operators: Increase or decrease the value of a variable by one (e.g., ++, --).

    8] Special Operators: Include sizeof (determines the size of a variable or data type), & (address-of operator), * (pointer dereference operator), and the comma operator (,).
